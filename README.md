### What's this website about?
Form's creates modals by JSON files, but don't worry, you can create JSONs without a JSON editor.

This site is a modal builder built for Forms, it creates modal JSONs for Forms to use by just clicking a few text boxes, and boom! You've got a modal ðŸŽ‰

### How do I use this?

1. Create a webhook (on [Discord](https://discord.com/app)), you'll need this for later.
2. Go to [form-builder.pages.dev][website]
3. Click and fill the text inputs (you'll need to use the same webhook you created in step 1 for the <kbd>Webhook URL</kbd> input)
4. Click the <kbd>Download JSON</kbd> button
5. Go back to Discord and run <kbd>/form create</kbd> with the <kbd>json</kbd> argument being the JSON you just downloaded
